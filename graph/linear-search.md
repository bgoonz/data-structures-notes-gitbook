# Linear Search



## Linear Search

In computer science, linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list for the target value until a match is found or until all the elements have been searched. Linear search runs in at worst linear time and makes at most `n` comparisons, where `n` is the length of the list.

### Complexity

**Time Complexity**: `O(n)` - since in worst case we're checking each element exactly once.
